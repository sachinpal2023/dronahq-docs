**Logging Custom Details**: In this section, you can log specific details, such as event names, the user who is logged in, organization ID, and more. This information will be useful for monitoring and analyzing your system's activities.

By following these simple steps, you can seamlessly enable, configure, and test the Audit Logging feature in your DronaHQ account. This powerful tool allows you to efficiently manage and monitor event logs within your modules, enhancing your overall experience with the platform.
